# My-Planner: week 7 challenge

## Description
This challenge illustrates the use of HTML, CSS and using JQuery to add to JavaScript to develop a Work-day planner application called 'My-Planner'. This allows you to add important events in your planner for your work day, dynamically update the present, past and future events using various color codes.

The codes were annotated carefully to allow anyone that accessed it to understand it easily and for continuity.
